> ## Short Explanation

In order to operate a drone within the Netherlands, it is mandatory to possess the neccessary legal documentation. To simplify the complex process of obtaining and managing the necessary legal documents for operating drones within the Netherlands, individuals can rely on the expertise of Droneconsultancy. This company specializes in assisting people with the setup and maintenance of these crucial documents.

Droneconsultancy encountered a challenge in maintaining the required documents due to ever-change regulations governing drones. These documents encompass multiple rules and regulations, which often undergo revisions. As a result, the company faces the task of consistenly updating and editing these rules across various documents for each individual client. This process is essential because these rules are reused in multiple documents for each client. 

Droneconsultancy not only has the responsibility of individually updating these regulations changes, but they also have to meticulously maintain records of which regulations are applied to each client. As one can imagine, this task can be monotonous and less enjoyable due to its repetitive nature.

To overcome this partical challenge, Droneconsultancy has assembled a dedicated team entrusted with the task of developing an innovative platform. Our goal was to create a cutting-edge solution that streamlines the process of maintaining and updating the essential legal documents. By implementing this platform, Droneconsultancy can effectively manage and track regulations, significantly simplifying compliance procedures for their clients.

> ## Project Goals

The main focus of this project is to develop a robust web application that serves as a comprehensive document storage system for Droneconsultancy. This web application will incorporate advanced features that allow the staff to effortlessly update regulations, ensuring that any modifications are automatically synchronized across all pertinent documents. By implementing this system, Droneconsultancy can significantly streamline the process of maintaining up-to-date documents, thereby ensuring that clients always have access to the most current regulatory information within their respective documents.


The project encompasses several key features:

- Authentication using Firebase Authentication: The system will utilize Firebase Authentication to ensure secure user authentication and access control.
- Creation, Editing, and Deletion of Legal Documents: Users will have the ability to create, edit, and delete legal documents relevant to their operations. This functionality enables easy management of necessary documentation.
- User Management: The system will provide functionality for creating, editing, and deleting user accounts. This allows Droneconsultancy to efficiently manage user access and permissions.
- Regulation Management: Users with the appropriate privileges can create, edit, and delete regulations within the system. This feature ensures that the regulatory framework remains up to date.
- Automatic Document Updates: Whenever regulations are modified, the system will automatically update the relevant documents. This ensures that clients have access to the most current regulatory information without manual intervention.
- Two User Roles: The system will support two distinct user roles - Moderator and Client. Moderators will have additional privileges, such as the ability to manage regulations and documents, while clients will have access to view and interact with their own documents.

By incorporating these features, the project aims to provide Droneconsultancy with a comprehensive web application that simplifies the management of legal documents, ensures regulatory compliance, and facilitates efficient user access and collaboration.

SeasForUs is a web app using Next.js and Laravel as the back-end framework. The frontend was created using Next.js and TypeScript to provide a good developer experience as well as other advantages like static site generation and image optimization. Data from users is sent to the server and stored in a MySQL database.

As a challenge from MLH, we are also using Auth0 for the authentication and use google OAuth for the provider. Auth0 provides us with the name and profile picture which we show on the website and looks really neat.

We also use Zustand & SWR for the store and fetching strategies so we can utilize the stale-while-revalidate which uses cache to make the whole experience feel snappy.

We actually won 2 categories which are

- **Sustainability: Runner Up**
- **Best Use of Auth0**

We won a $150 cash prize and some swags ðŸ¤‘. This is actually my first time winning a hackathon ([last hackathon](https://theodorusclarence.com/projects/love4heroes) I only won the Deloitte Challenge), and I'm really happy about it. In the uni, I'm not the type of person that likes to compete in several competitions. Hackathon is an exception, it is super fun to create an application at such a fast pace while still considering the quality

> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

Definitely, time is a problem, but Rizqi (front-end) and I, sprinted all of the UI and layout in just about 12 hours, we constantly work in a Zoom call so the process is fairly quick. I also use my [Starter Repo](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter) which helps a lot to get it started.

We also have some quirks about authentication with Auth0, because it is normally used with Node.js environment, and our backend team is using Laravel, so they need some time to implement the features.
